# Biquadris
cs246 final project(John Mai)

In this project, our group will work together to produce the video game Biquadris, which is a
Latinization of the game Tetris, expanded for two player competition.

   A game of Biquadris consists of two boards, each 11 columns wide and 15 rows high. Blocks
consisting of four cells (tetrominoes) appear at the top of each board, and you must drop them
onto their respective boards so as not to leave any gaps. Once an entire row has been filled, it
disappears, and the blocks above move down by one unit.

   Biquadris differs from Tetris in one significant way: it is not real-time. Players have as much time
as he want to decide where to place a block. Players will take turns dropping blocks, one at a
time. A player's turn ends when he/she has dropped a block onto the board (unless this triggers
a special action; see below). During a player's turn, the block that the opponent will have to play
next is already at the top of the opponent's board (and if it doesn't fitt, the opponent has lost).

   Further more, We add lot of interesting bonus in our game, such as Sound Effect(need use SFML in your system),
Reverse punishment, Extra Blocks(XBlock & CBlock) and extra level(level5), simple Mode and awaresome cover page

   Hope you enjoy the game!!!
